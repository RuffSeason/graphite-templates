This is a member of the "diverging color palatte" family. These are used for data where both large low and high values are interesting. There is also usually a well-defined midpoint in the data. For instance, if you are plotting changes in temperature from some baseline timepoint, it is best to use a diverging colormap to show areas with relative decreases and areas with relative increases.
