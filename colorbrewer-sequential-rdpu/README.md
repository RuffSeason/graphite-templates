Based on color specifications and designs developed by Cynthia Brewer (http://colorbrewer.org/). Specific hex codes taken from [D3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbostock/d3/master/lib/colorbrewer/colorbrewer.js).


This is a member of the "sequential color palette" family. This kind of color mapping is appropriate when data range from relatively low or unintersting values to relatively high or interesting values, e.g. in a heatmap.
